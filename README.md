## üéÆ MY REAL JOURNEY  
*(spoiler: it's like a TED Talk written at 3 AM)*

### üß© Level One: Where It All Began

Picture this: it's 2019, lockdown hits, and 15-year-old me stumbles into Discord ‚Äî just messing around ‚Äî and ends up building a community that actually took off.  
Started flipping Pok√©mon cards and in-game currencies for laughs.  
First time someone paid? Unreal.

> ‚ÄúNo roadmap. Just curiosity and chaos.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî me, absolutely winging it (and somehow it worked)

### üöÄ Made It Look Cool. Made It Make Money.

Next stop: **LaVisuals** ‚Äî a global creative community born from Discord and anime obsession.

What came out of it:
- Animated banners that slapped
- 3D avatars with personality
- Custom trading cards (yes, really)
- The biggest anime card game on Discord

**The numbers:**
- 1,000+ artists in our network
- 100+ card makers collaborating
- Funding from Anime Soul
- One very proud 16-year-old

> It began as just-for-fun. Before I knew it, there were late-night orders, DMs, and a wave of demand I didn't know what to do with.  
> *Nobody else was doing it like this. Basically invented a whole vibe.*

### üéØ Chaos, Crashes & Comebacks

Tried a bit of everything ‚Äî and I mean everything:
- Built bots, ran gaming servers
- Hosted Minecraft tourneys (till Discord banned us... oops)
- Created investment servers & game nights
- Got the verified bot dev badge üèÜ
- Made products that went viral
- Made products that flopped (hard)

Took some L's. Took some learning.
